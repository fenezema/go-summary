# Introduction

## What is?
So what is Golang? 
1. Go is an open source programming language supported by Google
2. Easy to learn and get started with
3. Built-in concurrency and a robust standard library
4. Growing ecosystem of partners, communities, and tools

At least, those are the points that mentioned in the official page of [Golang](https://go.dev). Whether it is true or not, you can decide it yourself after finishing all the sections available on this Crash Course Week 9 Summary

## How to - Install
We can visit the [official page](https://go.dev/dl/) to download Go for whatever OS you're using. We won't go on too much detail on how to install Golang for your system. This [Quick Setup](https://go.dev/doc/) would sufficient for our cases.

## How to - Installation Check
The [Quick Setup](https://go.dev/doc/) would pretty much mention on how to check if the Go is already installed correctly. But in this section, we just want to make sure all things works correctly. 

If Go is already installed, when you run<br>
```
go version
```
<br>
Should print out the version of the Golang you are using. We would recommend you to use the latest stable version of Go (which is 1.18 as of now), but feel free to download any version of your need.

## How to - Simple Code Run
There are a few `go <command>` that we need to know. First of all, we can always refer to the official docs for the commands and tools available. 

You can even use 
```
go help
```
This command will print out any command we can use during our development time.
